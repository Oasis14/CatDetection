# CatDetection
For CSCI-4830-018 ML for Human-Computer Interaction

### Add xml cat facial detection to library path
Run the processing program. The console will display where the cascade files are found. On my mac it was located in ``` /Users/MyUserName/Documents/Processing/libraries/opencv_processing/library/cascade-files/``` I placed the file ```haarcascade_frontalcatface_extended.xml`` in to this folder to be able to use it.
